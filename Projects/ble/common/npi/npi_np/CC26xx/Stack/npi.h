  Description:    This file contains the Network Processor Interface (NPI),
                  which abstracts the physical link between the Application
                  Processor (AP) and the Network Processor (NP). The NPI
                  serves as the HAL's client for the SPI and UART drivers, and
                  provides API and callback services for its client.
