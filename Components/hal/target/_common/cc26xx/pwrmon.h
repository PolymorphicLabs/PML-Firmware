// where 'whole' volts are located in bits 8-10 (0x700) and the 'fraction'
// is located in bits 0-7 (0x0FF). The 'fraction' (0.00-0.99) is scaled
// linearly across the digital values of 0x00-0xFF, with 0x80 = 0.50 volt,
// 0xFF = 0.99 volt, etc.

// somewhat below the CC26xx brown-out threshold. It is intended that the
// user will modify these values appropriately for their system needs.
